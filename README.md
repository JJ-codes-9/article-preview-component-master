## My process
The biggest challenge was figuring out how to create the interaction that enables the popup to toggle when clicked. It required a good understanding of JavaScript and how to manipulate the DOM dynamically. Another challenge was making the layout responsive, especially ensuring the elements align properly in mobile view. I tackled these by breaking the problems into smaller steps—debugging and testing the popup logic separately before integrating it—and refining the CSS media queries for better responsiveness.
